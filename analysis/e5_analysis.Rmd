PSYCH 130 - EXPERIMENT 4 ANALYSIS
=================================

Preliminaries.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
source("analysis/useful_dplyr.R")
library("rjson")
```

Read in files and consolidate to the same directory. 

```{r}
files <- dir("production-results/e5/", pattern = "*.json")
d.raw <- data.frame()

for (f in files) {
  jf <- paste("production-results/e5/",f,sep="")
  jd <- fromJSON(paste(readLines(jf), collapse=""))
  id <- data.frame(workerid = jd$WorkerId, 
                   scale = jd$answer$scale,
                   degree = jd$answer$degree,
                   stars = jd$answer$manipulation_level,
                   judgment = as.numeric(jd$answer$judgment),
                   language = jd$answer$language)
  d.raw <- bind_rows(d.raw, id)
}
```

Exclude non-compliant participants and non-English speakers. 

```{r}
compliant <- d.raw %>% 
  filter(grepl("training", scale)) %>%
  group_by(workerid) %>%
  summarise(compliant = judgment[scale == "training1"] == 5 & 
              judgment[scale == "training2"] == 1)
  
d <- d.raw %>% 
  left_join(compliant) %>%
  filter(grepl(pattern = "english", 
               language, ignore.case = TRUE), 
         domain != "training1", 
         domain != "training2", 
         compliant == TRUE)
```

Main Analysis
-------------

First look at means broken down by epistemic condition.

```{r}
ms <- d %>%
  group_by(knowledge) %>%
  summarise(cil = ci.low(judgment), 
            cih = ci.high(judgment), 
            judgment = mean(judgment))

pdf("plots/e4.pdf",width=4)
qplot(x = knowledge, y = judgment, fill=knowledge, 
      geom = "bar", stat = "identity", 
      position = "dodge", 
      data = ms) + 
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = judgment - cil, 
                     ymax = judgment + cih),
                 position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + 
  ylab("Does the inference follow? 1=yes, 0=no")
dev.off()
```

Next break down by domain condition. 

```{r}
ms <- d %>%
  group_by(domain, knowledge) %>%
  summarise(cil = ci.low(judgment), 
            cih = ci.high(judgment), 
            judgment = mean(judgment), 
            n = n())

# pdf("plots/e3_level.pdf")
qplot(x = domain, y = judgment, 
      fill = knowledge,
      geom = "bar", stat = "identity", 
      position = "dodge", 
      data = ms) + 
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = judgment - cil, 
                     ymax = judgment + cih),
                 position = position_dodge(width=.9)) + 
  ylab("Does the inference follow? 1=yes, 0=no")
# dev.off()
```

Statistics 

```{r}

summary(glmer(judgment ~ knowledge + (1 | workerid) + 
                (knowledge | domain), 
              data = d,
              family = "binomial"))

summary(glmer(judgment ~ knowledge + (1 | workerid) + 
                (1 | domain), 
              data = d,
              family = "binomial"))

```
