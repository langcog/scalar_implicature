\begin{abstract}
Successful communication regularly requires listeners to make pragmatic
inferences - enrichments beyond the literal meaning of a speaker's
utterance. For example, when interpreting a sentence such as ``Alice ate
some of the cookies,'' listeners routinely infer that Alice did not eat
all of them. A Gricean account of this phenomena assumes the presence of
alternatives (like ``all of the cookies'') with varying degrees of
informativity, but it remains an open question precisely what these
alternatives are. We use a computational model of pragmatic inference to
test hypotheses about how well different sets of alternatives allow us
to predict scalar implicature performance across a range of different
scales. Our findings suggest that human comprehenders likely consider a
much broader set of alternatives beyond those entailed by the initial
description.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

How much of what we mean comes from the words that go unsaid? As
listeners, our ability to make precise inferences about a speaker's
intended meaning in context is an indispensable component of successful
communication. For example, listeners commonly enrich the meaning of the
scalar item \emph{some} to \emph{some but not all} in sentences like
``Alice ate some of the cookies'' (Grice, 1975; Horn, 1984; Levinson,
2000). These inferences, called \emph{scalar implicatures}, have been an
important test case for understanding pragmatic inferences more
generally. A Gricean account of this phenomena assumes listeners reason
about the meaning the speaker intended by incorporating knowledge about
a) alternative scalar items a speaker could have used (such as
\emph{all}) and b) the relative informativity of using such alternatives
(Grice, 1975). According to this account, a listener will infer that the
speaker must have intended that Alice did not eat \emph{all} the cookies
because it would have been underinformative for the speaker to use
\emph{some} when \emph{all} could have been used.

But what are the alternatives that should be considered in this
computation more generally? Under classic accounts of implicature,
listeners consider only those words whose meaning would entail the word
that is actually sent (Horn, 1972), and these alternatives enter into
conventionalized or semi-conventionalized scales (Levinson, 2000). For
example, because \emph{all} entails \emph{some}, and hence is a
``stronger'' meaning, \emph{all} should be considered as an alternative
to \emph{some} in implicatures. Similar scales exist for non-quantifier
scales, e.g. \emph{loved} entails \emph{liked} (and hence ``I liked the
movie'' implicates that I didn't love it).

Recent empirical evidence has called into question whether entailment
scales are all that is necessary for understanding scalar implicature.
For example, Degen \& Tanenhaus (2015) demonstrated that the scalar item
\emph{some} was judged less appropriate when exact numbers were seen as
viable alternatives. And in a different paradigm, Tiel (2014) found
converging evidence that \emph{some} was judged to be atypical for small
quantities. These data provide indirect evidence about a broader set of
alternatives: since \emph{some} is logically true of sets with one or
two members, these authors argued that the presence of salient
alternatives (the words \emph{one} and \emph{two}) reduced the felicity
of \emph{some} via a pragmatic inference.

By formalizing pragmatic reasoning, computational models can help
provide more direct evidence about the role that alternatives play. The
``rational speech act'' model (RSA) is one recent framework for
understanding inferences about meaning in context (Frank \& Goodman,
2012; N. D. Goodman \& Stuhlm{Ã¼}ller, 2013). RSA models frame language
understanding as a special case of social cognition, in which listeners
and speakers reason recursively about one another's goals. In the case
of scalar implicature, a listener makes a probabilistic inference about
what the speaker's most likely communicative goal was, given that she
picked the quantifier \emph{some} rather than the stronger quantifier
\emph{all}. In turn, the speaker reasons about what message would best
convey her intended meaning to the listener, given that he is reasoning
in this way. This recursion is grounded in a ``literal'' listener who
reasons only according to the basic truth-functional semantics of the
language.

Franke (2014) used an RSA-style model to assess what alternatives a
speaker would need to consider in order to produce the
typicality/felicity ratings reported by Degen \& Tanenhaus (2015) and
Tiel (2014). In order to do this, Franke (2014)'s model assigned weights
to a set of alternative numerical expressions. Surprisingly, along with
weighting \emph{one} highly (a conclusion that was supported by the
empirical work), the best-fitting model assigned substantial weight to
\emph{none} as an alternative. This finding was especially surprising
considering the emphasis of standard theories on scalar items that stand
in entailment relationships with one another (e.g. \emph{one} entails
\emph{some} even if it is not classically considered to be part of the
scale).

In our current work, we pick up where these previous studies left off,
considering the set of alternatives for implicature using the RSA model.
To gain empirical traction on this issue, however, we broaden the set of
scales we consider. Our inspiration for this move comes from work by Van
Tiel, Van Miltenburg, Zevakhina, \& Geurts (2014), who examined a
phenomenon that they dubbed ``scalar diversity,'' namely the substantial
difference in the strength of scalar implicature across a variety of
scalar pairs (e.g. \emph{liked/loved,} or \emph{palatable/delicious.}).
Making use of some of this diversity allows us to investigate the ways
that different alternative sets give rise to implicatures of different
strengths across scales.

We begin by presenting the computational framework we use throughout the
paper. We next describe a series of experiments designed to measure both
the literal semantics of a set of scalar items and comprehenders'
pragmatic judgments for these same items. These experiments allow us to
compare the effects of different alternative sets on our ability to
model listeners' pragmatic judgments. To preview our results: we find
that standard entailment alternatives do not allow us to fit
participants' judgments, but that expanding the range of alternatives
empirically (by asking participants to generate alternative messages)
allows us to model listener judgments with high accuracy.

\section{Modeling Implicature Using
RSA}\label{modeling-implicature-using-rsa}

We begin by giving a brief presentation of the basic RSA model. This
model simulates the judgments of a pragmatic listener who wants to infer
a speaker's intended meaning \(m\) from her utterance \(u\). For
simplicity, we present a version of this model in which there is only
full recursion: that is, the pragmatic listener reasons about a
pragmatic speaker, who in turn reasons about a ``literal listener.'' We
assume throughout that this computation takes place in a signaling game
(Lewis, 1969) with a fixed set of possible meanings \(m \in M\) and a
fixed possible set of utterances \(u \in U\), with both known to both
participants. Our goal in this study is to determine what utterances
fall in \(U\).

In the standard RSA model, the pragmatic listener (denoted \(L_1\)),
makes a Bayesian inference:

\[p_{L1}(m \mid u) \propto p_{S_1} (u \mid m) p(m)\]

\noindent In other words, the probability of a particular meaning given
an utterance is proportional to the speaker's probability of using that
particular utterance to express that meaning, weighted by a prior over
meanings. This prior represents the listener's \emph{a priori}
expectations about plausible meanings, independent of the utterance.
Because our experiments take place in a context in which listeners
should have very little expectation about which meanings speakers want
to convey, for simplicity we assume a uniform prior \(p(m) \propto 1\).

The pragmatic speaker in turn considers the probability that a literal
listener would interpret her utterance correctly:

\[ p_{S_1}(u \mid m) \propto p_{L_0} (m \mid u)\]

\noindent where \(L_0\) refers to a listener who only considers the
truth-functional semantics of the utterance (that is, which meanings the
utterance can refer to).

This model of the pragmatic speaker (denoted \(S_1\)) is consistent with
a speaker who chooses words to maximize the utility of an utterance in
context (Frank \& Goodman, 2012), where utility is operationalized as
the informativity of a particular utterance (surprisal) minus a cost:

\[p_{S_1}(u \mid m) \propto e^{-\alpha(-log(p_{L_0}(m \mid u)) - C(u))}\]

\noindent where \(C(u)\) is the cost of a particular utterance,
\(-log(p_{L_0})\) represents the \emph{surprisal} for the literal
listener (the information content of the utterance), and \(\alpha\) is a
parameter in a standard choice rule. If \(\alpha=0\), speakers choose
randomly and as \(\alpha \rightarrow \infty\), they greedily choose the
highest probability alternative. In our simulations below, we treat
\(\alpha\) as a free parameter and fit it to the data.

To instantiate our signaling game with a tractable message set \(M\), in
our studies we adopt a food-review paradigm: we assume that speakers and
listeners are trying to communicate the number of stars in an online
restaurant review (where \(m \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)). We then use
experiments to measure three components of the model. First, to measure
literal semantics \({p_{L_0} (m \mid u)}\) (we ask experiment
participants to judge whether a message is compatible with a particular
meaning (Experiment 1). Second, to generate a set of plausible
alternative messages in \(U\), we elicit alternatives directly
(Experiment 2). Lastly, to obtain human \(L_1\) pragmatic judgments, we
ask participants to interpret a speaker's utterances (Experiment 3).

\section{Experiment 1: Literal listener
task}\label{experiment-1-literal-listener-task}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics{figs/allScalesTable-1} \caption[Stimuli for Experiments 1, 2, and 3]{Stimuli for Experiments 1, 2, and 3}\label{fig:allScalesTable}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[t]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/stimuli_exp1-1} 

}

\caption[(Left) A trial from Experiment 1 (literal listener) with the target scalar `liked]{(Left) A trial from Experiment 1 (literal listener) with the target scalar `liked.' (Right) A trial from Experiment 3 (pragmatic listener) with the target scalar `liked.'}\label{fig:stimuli_exp1}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

Experiment 1 was conducted to approximate literal listener semantic
distributions \(p_{L_0}(m \mid u)\) for five pairs of scalar items taken
from Tiel (2014). We include three conditions in Experiment 1,
corresponding to the sets of alternatives within a scale that
participants were presented with: two-alternatives (``entailment''),
four-alternatives, and five-alternatives. The two-alternatives
entailment condition makes a test of the hypothesis that the two members
of the classic Horn scale (Horn, 1972) are the only alternatives
necessary to predict the strength of listeners' pragmatic inference. The
four- and five-alternatives conditions then add successively more
alternatives to test whether including a larger number of alternatives
will increase model
fit.\footnote{Note that alternatives in the four- and five-alternatives conditions were chosen on the basis of Experiment 2, which was run chronologically after the two-alternative condition; all literal listener experiments are grouped together for simplicity in reporting.}
A secondary goal of Experiments 1a,b,c tests whether the set of
alternatives queried during literal semantic elicitation impacts
compatibility judgments. (If it does we should see differences in
compatibility judgments for shared items between experiments.) We
address this possibility in the results section.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

In each condition we recruited 30 participants from Amazon Mechanical
Turk (AMT). In the two-alternative condition, 16 participants were
excluded
\footnote{The majority of respondent data excluded from Experiment 1a was caused by failure to pass training trials. We believe the task may have been too difficult for most respondents and made adjustments to the training trials in Experiments 1b,c}
for either failing to pass two training trails or were not native
English speakers, leaving a total sample of 14 participants. In the
four-alternative condition, 7 participants were excluded for either
failing to pass two training trials or were not native English speakers,
leaving a total sample of 23 participants. In the five-alternative
condition, 3 participants were excluded for either failing to pass two
training trials or were not native English speakers, leaving a total
sample of 27.

\subsubsection{Design and procedure}\label{design-and-procedure}

Figure \ref{fig:stimuli_exp1}, left, shows the experimental setup.
Participants were presented with a target scalar item and a star rating
(1--5 stars) and asked to judge the compatibility of the scalar item and
star rating. Compatibility was assessed through a binary ``yes/no''
response to a question of the form, ``Do you think that the person
thought the food was \_\_\_\_?" where a target scalar was presented in
the blank. Each participant saw all scalar item and star rating
combinations for their particular condition, in a random order.

The two-alternatives condition included only the scalar pairs from Tiel
(2014). The four-alternatives condition included the two scalar items
plus the top two alternatives generated for each scalar family by
participants in Experiment 2. The five-alternatives condition included
the four previous items plus one more ``neutral'' item chosen from those
alternatives generated in Experiment 2. See Figure
\ref{fig:allScalesTable} for the complete list of alternatives used in
each condition.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion}

Rows are grouped by scale and items within rows are ordered by valence. Colors indicate the specific experiment (1a,b,c) with experiments including different numbers of items.}\label{fig:exp1Plots}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

Figure \ref{fig:exp2Plots} plots literal listener \(p_{L0}(m|u)\) scalar
item distributions for the three conditions. Each row shows a unique
scalar family with items ordered horizontally by valence. Several trends
are visible. First, in each scale, the alternatives spanned the star
scale, such that there were alternatives that were highly compatible
with both the lowest and highest numbers of stars. Second, there was
clear variability between scalar families. For example, compatibility
judgments for the top items in the \emph{memorable / unforgettable}
scale were more similar than those for \emph{good / excellent} or
\emph{liked / loved.} Finally, there was substantial consistency in
ratings for items that were repeated across experiments, suggesting that
this paradigm elicited stable judgments from participants.

To test our secondary hypothesis, that the different sets of scalar
items queried might result in differences in compatibility judgments
between experiments, we ran a mixed effects model. We regressed
compatibility judgments on scale, number of stars and experiment
(1a,b,c), with subject and word level random effects, which was the
maximal structure that converged. Results indicate no significant
differences between Experiment 1a and 1c, \(b =\)-0.05, \(Z =\) -0.53,
\(p =\) 0.59 or between 1b and 1c, \(b =\) -0.04, \(Z =\) -0.52 \(p =\)
0.6 and the addition of our experiment predictor did not significantly
improve model fit when compared to a model without the experiment
variable using ANOVA \(\chi^2(\) 2 \() =\) 0.43, \(p =\) 0.81.

\section{Experiment 2: Alternative
Elicitation}\label{experiment-2-alternative-elicitation}

To elicit empirical alternatives for the scales we used in Experiment 1,
we adopted a modified cloze task inspired by Experiment 3 of Tiel
(2014).

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods-1}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited 30 workers on AMT. All participants were native English
speakers and naive to the purpose of the experiment.

\subsubsection{Design and procedure}\label{design-and-procedure-1}

Participants were presented a target scalar item from our original
entailment set (see Figure \ref{fig:allScalesTable}) embedded in a
sentence such as, ``In a recent restaurant review someone said they
thought they the food was \_\_\_\_," with a target scalar presented in
the blank. Participants were then asked to generate plausible
alternatives by responding to the question, ``If they'd felt differently
about the food, what other words could they have used instead of
\_\_\_\_?" They were prompted to generate three unique alternatives.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion-1}

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Figure \ref{fig:exp2_altsPlot_likedLoved} shows an example alternative
set for the scalar items \emph{liked} and \emph{loved} (combined).
Alternative distributions for the other scalar pairs (e.g..
\emph{good/excellent}, \emph{memorable/unforgettable}) were similarly
long-tailed.

\section{Experiment 3: Pragmatic
Listener}\label{experiment-3-pragmatic-listener}

Experiment 3 was conducted to measure pragmatic judgments
\(p_{L_1}(m \mid u)\) for five pairs of scalar items taken from Tiel
(2014). We include two conditions in Experiment 3. In the
two-alternatives condition, participants made judgments for items
included in the entailment scales. In the four-alternatives condition,
participants made judgments for the entailment items and also the top
two alternatives elicited for each scale in Experiment 2. Running two
pragmatic judgment conditions allowed us to rule out the potential
effects of having a larger set of alternatives during the pragmatic
judgment elicitation and also provided two sets of human judgments to
compare with model
predictions\footnote{Note that alternatives in the four-alternatives condition were chosen on the basis of Experiment 2, which was run chronologically after the two-alternatives condition; both pragmatic listener experiments are grouped together for simplicity in reporting.}.
A secondary goal of Experiment 3b tests whether the set of alternatives
queried in Experiments 3a,b impacts pragmatic judgments. (If it does we
should see differences in pragmatic judgments between experiments.) We
address this possibility in the results section.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-2}

We recruited 100 participants from AMT, 50 for each condition. Data for
9 participants was excluded after participants either failed to pass two
training trials or were non-native English speakers, leaving a total
sample of 41 participants. In the four-alternative condition, data from
7 participants was excluded after participants either failed to pass two
training trials or were not native English speakers, leaving a total
sample of 43 participants.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Participants were presented with a one-sentence prompt containing a
target scalar item such as ``Someone said they thought the food was
\_\_\_\_\_.'' Participants were then asked to generate a star rating
representing the rating they thought the reviewer likely gave. Each
participant was presented with all scalar items in a random order. The
experimental setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:stimuli_exp1}, right.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion-2}

Figure \ref{fig:exp2Plots} plots pragmatic listener judgments
distributions for ``weak'' / ``strong'' scalar pairs (e.g.
\emph{good}/\emph{excellent}). We only include the original entailment
pairs in this figure for simplicity. Several trends are visible. First,
in each scale participants generated implicatures and were less likely
to assign high star-ratings to weaker scalar terms, despite literal
semantic compatibility. Second, the ``size'' of the difference between
judgments between ``strong'' and ``weak'' scalar items varied by scale,
consistent with results from Tiel (2014).

To test our secondary hypothesis, that the different sets of scalar
items queried might result in differences in pragmatic judgments between
experiments, we ran a mixed effects model. We regressed pragmatic
judgments on scale and experiment (3a,b) with subject and word level
random effects, which was the maximal structure that converged. Results
indicate there were no significant differences between Experiment 3a and
3b, \(b =\) 0.05, \(t(\) 150 \() =\) 1.04, \(p =\) 0.3 and the addition
of our experiment predictor did not significantly improve model fit when
compared to a model without the experiment variable using ANOVA
\(\chi^2(\) 1 \() =\) 1.13, \(p =\) 0.29.

\section{Model Results}\label{model-results}

Using literal semantic data from Experiments 1a,b,c we conducted three
simulations with our model. Each simulation used the specific literal
semantic data to specify the scale representation available to our
model.

\end{CodeChunk}

\section{General Discussion}\label{general-discussion}

By varying the type of scale representations available to our Bayesian
model we investigated the effects of alternatives on scalar implicature.
Model fit with human judgments was significantly improved by the
inclusion of alternatives beyond the typical ``strong'' and ``weak''
scalar items. The two-alternatives model contained only entailment
items, which, under classic accounts, should be sufficient to generate
implicature. Model performance with this limited alternative set was
poor when compared to human judgments from Experiment 3a,b (row 1, Table
\ref{xtable}). Building off findings in Franke (2014), in which the
best-fitting model assigned substantial weight to \emph{none} as an
alternative, we included a ``generic'' negative alternative that was
only compatible with 1-star. Model fit for this modified entailment
alternative set did improve, however overall correlation was still low
(row 2, Table \ref{xtable}). Model fit jumped substantially by adding
the top-two alternatives for each scale (row 3, Table \ref{xtable}).
Finally, our five-alternatives model included a neutral alternative
along with the original entailment pair and top two (row 4, Table
\ref{xtable}).

While model improvement seemed to be related to the number of
alternatives present, we did not see substantial differences between our
four- and five-alternative models. One possibility is that alternatives
are differentially salient in context. Our current framework makes the
simplifying assumption that all alternatives are equally salient.
However, it may well be the case that while both \emph{all} and
\emph{most} are \emph{present} during pragmatic enrichment of
\emph{some}, \emph{all} is more salient and therefore should carry
greater weight in our model. Findings from Experiment 2, in which
participants generated plausible alternatives, support this intuition,
as some alternatives appeared more often than others. This distinction
between binary \emph{presence} and graded \emph{salience} is an
important one that deserves further investigation.

It is also likely that the precise set of alternatives present during
implicature are domain dependent. Our current empirical paradigm
elicited literal semantics, pragmatic judgments and plausible
alternatives all within the restricted domain of restaurant reviews.
Participant data may have differed greatly if we had instead asked them
to respond in a movie review paradigm, which would have been acceptable
for a number of our stimuli (e.g. \emph{memorable}/\emph{unforgettable},
\emph{liked}/\emph{loved}, etc.).

Considering the possibility that alternative sets may be domain specific
even for scalar items may provide a way forward in uniting generalized
and particularized implicatures. Findings from our investigation
indicate that human literal semantic and pragmatic judgments are often
graded and diverse, much like the set of plausible alternatives that
give rise to pragmatic inferences.
