# scalar_implicature
A series of experiments looking at scalar implicature


e1 - e4
-------
Studies from Pysch130

e5
---
Preliminary literal listener study - we present a star rating and scalar target and ask how compatibiliyt the target is with the rating on a 5pt likert.

e6
---
Pragmatic listener study. We present respondents with a scalar target and ask them how many stars are appropriate.

e7
---
Star prior elicitation attempt - respondents are given several scenarios and asked to give us the number of stars they think are appropriate.

e8
---
Literal listener experiment with binary DV. We're moving from the 5-pt likert compatibility DV to see if we can get better differentiation between scalar items

e9
---
Experiment to elicit salient alternative. Basic framework taken from van Tiel Scalar Diversity study. For each scalar item we ask respondents to give us 3 alternatives words that could have been used "if the speaker had felt differently". 

e10
---
Literal listener binary var study with top two alts taken from e9

e11
---
Pragmatic listener study with alternatives scalar (from e9) included.
