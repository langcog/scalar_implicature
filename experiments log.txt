* Experiment 1:
- similarity judgment a la degen 2014
- six scales
- six domains
- three comparison conditions - upper/lower/full 
- 100 participants
- note that we flipped one of the order labels such that upper and lower are reversed

* Experiment 2
- identical to experiment 1 except we adopt the DV from van Tiel 2015
  - inference 2AFC
  - context sentence, inference sentence, question
- hypothesis is that we should replicate E1 and van Tiel's implicature patterns
