* Experiment 1:
- similarity judgment a la degen 2014
- six scales
- six domains
- three comparison conditions - upper/lower/full 
- 100 participants on 2/10
- note that we flipped one of the order labels such that upper and lower are reversed
- results support differentiation across scales

* Experiment 2
- identical to experiment 1 except we adopt the DV from van Tiel 2015
  - inference 2AFC
  - context sentence, inference sentence, question
- hypothesis is that we should replicate E1 and van Tiel's implicature patterns
- ran 100 participants on 2/24

* Experiment 3 
- began development 2/24
- goal is to create an epistemic manipulation, following bergen & grodner (2012)
  - manipulate how much Bob/John know about the particular situation they are in.
- collected  100 participants 2/26 
- data collection overnight, not sure how much that matters. 
- nothing much happened with epistemic manipulation - in hindsight, probably because the knowledge wasn't targeted enough at the particular scalar claim made by the speaker.

* Experiment 4
- began development 3/3
- epistemic manipulation mark 2
- remove all scalars except "some"

* Experiment 5
- began development 3/3
- base rate manipulation
- remove all scalars except "some"
